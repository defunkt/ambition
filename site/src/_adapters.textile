Adapters are gems named @ambitious-something@, where _something_ corresponds to the data
store they are adapting.  They can be required in code via @ambition/adapters/something@.

To install and test the ActiveRecord adapter:

<pre>
$ gem install ambitious-activerecord
$ irb 
>> require 'rubygems'
>> require 'ambition/adapters/activerecord'
</pre>

Adapters typically inject themselves into their target automatically, so that should be
all you need.

There are a few adapters in development or released currently:

  * "ActiveRecord":adapters/activerecord.html
  * ActiveLDAP
  * Facebook
  * XPath
  * CouchDB
  * DataMapper
